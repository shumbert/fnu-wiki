# Hyperfocal distance
- closest distance at which a lens can be focused while keeping objects at infinity acceptably sharp
- what's acceptibly in focus is everything from half that distance all the way to infinity

# Diffraction
- when using a smaller opening you will get a softer image
- typically if using anything past f/14

# Where to focus
For instance with f/5.6 aperture and 20mm focal length:
- hyperfocal distance is 2.38m
- if focusing at infinity everything from 2.35m to infinity is sharp
- if focusing at hyperfocal distance everything from 1.19m to infinity is sharp
- if focusing at 2x hyperfocal distance everything from 1.57m to infinity is sharp

In theory focusing at the hyperfocal distance gives the best results. However in most cases there will be no objects that close to the camera, so focusing at infinity yields similar results.

Also when focusing at less than the hyperfocal distance objects in the background may get ouf of focus, so it's safer to focus at twice the hyperfocal distance.
