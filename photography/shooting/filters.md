# Filters
## Types of filters
- screw-on filters: if you have lenses with different opening sizes you need several filters
- better to use a holder system with an adapter ring

## Polarizing filters
- reduce glare from reflective surfaces, such as glass, metal, water, and blue skies
- greatest glare comes from vertical light waves, and glare is most intense when the sun is at a 90-degree angle to you
- the filter blocks out vertical light, allowing the more pleasing and saturated colors created by horizontal light to be recorded
- most effective when shooting at 90-degree angle to the sun (midday, or shooting north or south in morning or late-afternoon)
- **it's the one filter you cannot replace with post-processing**

## Neutral-density filters
- knock down the overall brightness without interfering with the overall color
- it allows you to use larger lens opening (resulting in shallower depth of field) or slower shutter speeds
- some neutral-density filters are gradual
  - good if you have landscapes with a lighter sky
  - but you can achieve similar by taking several exposures and then blending them in post-processing
