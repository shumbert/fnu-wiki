# Aperture
The aperture is a "hole" located inside the lense. Aperture settings:
- f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6: isolation apertures with shallow depth of field
- f/8, f/11: who cares apertures (optimal sharpness and contrast)
- f/16, f/22, f/32: story-telling apertures with great depth of field

To obtain front to back sharpness: select the smallest aperture, focus 1/3 of the way into the scene

Story-telling apertures: preset focus with distance settings instead of focusing in the scene. On single-focal-length lenses use depth-of-field scales, otherwise use the distance settings. Alternatively focus 1/3 in the scene.

# Shutter
Shutter settings:
- 1/250, 1/500, 1/1000: freeze action exposures
- 1/15, 1/30, 1/60: panning exposures
- 1, 1/2, 1/4: imply motion exposures

## Freezing motion
- the closer to the subject, the faster the shutter speed must be.
- if subject fills the frame, use 1/1000
- 10 to 20 feet, use 1/500 at least
- 100 feet, use 1/125

## Panning
- move the camera parallel to -and at the same speed as- the action
- use slow shutter speeds (1/60 to 1/8)
- if using a tripod keep the head loose

## Implying motion
- use 1/2 for cotton effect with waterfalls and streams
- use 8sec for turning traffic in red-and-white streaks
- you can also move the camera or zoom in/out while taking the exposure

# ISO
when using higher ISOs, contrast and color will be decreased

# Stops
Each halving or doubling of the amount of light is referred to as a full stop.
- for aperture: f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, ...
- for speed: 1/500, 1/250, 1/125, 1/60, ...
- for iso: 100, 200, 400, ...

# Light
Best light in early morning or late afternoon/early evening. Early morning light is a bit cooler than the golden-orange light of sunset.

Digital cameras can record light and dark scenes as long as the difference between light and dark in limited to 6-7 stops. Human eyes can see a 16 stops range from lights to darks.

## Types of light
### Frontlight
- light is facing the subject
- easiest light to work with in terms of metering
- quality and color of frontlight is best after sunrise or in the last hours of daylight

### Overcast frontlight
- illuminate subjects evenly, making meter reading simple
- softness of the light results in more natural-looking portraits

### Sidelight
- highlights and shadows create illusion of three-dimensionality
- after sunrise or before sunset, sidelight subjects abound when shooting towards north or south

### Backlight
- take a light reading from the sky left or right of the sun
- to properly expose for the main subject, get really close and take a meter reading from the light reflecting off the subject, then go back and take the shot
- you can also use flash to illuminate the subject
- backlight is good as well when shooting somewhat transparent objects (leaves, flowers, ...)

## Metering
Light-meter settings:
- use matrix metering preferrably
- take an additional shot at 2/3 stop (may get better contrast and color saturation)

### Gray card
- you can use a gray card to properly expose bright and dark subjects (white sandy beaches, snow-covered fields, black animals, blacky shiny cars, ...)
- hold the gray card in front of the lens and meter the light reflecting off the card
- you can use your palm instead of the gray card:
  - first calibrate your plam, in full sun take the gray card, set aperture to f/8, fill the frame with the gray card (it doesn't have to be in focus) and adjust shutter speed for correct exposure
  - now hold the palm of your hand in front of the camera, it should read +2/3 to 1 stop overexposed
  - take note of the offset, next time you shoot take a reading off your plam and apply the offset

### Metering off the sky
- you can take light reading from the sky for shots where the light meter might get confused (such as sidelight and backlight)
- take a meter reading off the sky on sunny days
- take a meter reading off the sky for shots at dusk
- take a meter reading to the side of the sun for backlist sunrise or sunset
- take a meter reading off the light reflecting water for coastal scenes or lake reflections at sunrise or sunset

### Metering off green area
- for shots in a lot of green of them, take a meter reading off the vegetation
- don't go for the center, expose at -2/3 stop

# White balance
Kelvin scale:
- 2000K to 4000K: warm colors (red)
- 4000K to 7000K: daylight
- 7000K to 11000K: cool colors (blue)

Cool lights: cloudy, rainy, foggy or snowy day. Warm lights: dawn and dusk.

White balance setting:
- outdoor shooting: cloudy
- outdoor shooting at dusk: tungsten
- indoor shooting w/ household lighting: tungsten
- indoor shooting w/ office lighting: florescent

# Misc
If not possible to get dead-center in the light meter, aim for 1/3 or 2/3 stops **below** center.

Wide-angle lenses: pushes everything in a scene to the background, expects you to place something in the immediate foreground.

Specular highlights:
- in close-up photography any out-of-focus spot of light will record of coloured circles or hexagons
- select the widest aperture to obtain circles, smaller apertures will render hexagons
