## Lenses hood
- useful, not so much for sun but for rain
- also avoid light hitting front of the lens for backlight scenes

# Cleaning
Cleaning your lens:
- alcohol wipes are good to get rid of grease at the front of the lens
- then remove any remaining dust with a dry cloth

Sensor cleaning:
- to spot dust, take a picture of a white background with a narrow aperture (f/22)
- use a nylon brush (get an expensive one so that nylon strings don't fall off onto the sensors)
- blow air on the brush to create a static charge

# Settings
- do focus with the AF-ON button (and remove focus from the shutter button)
- focus peaking: puts blue or red dots around elements which are in focus

# Test your camera
## ISO
- What ISO your camera can go to and still maintain a good level of quality?
- How to test:
  - take several shots of a given scene using different ISO setting
  - compare images and look for loss of details, contrast, ...

## Aperture
- What aperture you can go up to before getting diffraction?
- How to test:
  - select a scene where everything will be in focus (no elements close to the camera)
  - take several shots of that scene using different aperture setting
  - look for softness in the image

## Focus
- given you focus at infinity which elements will be in focus based on the aperture setting?
- How to test depth of field:
  - select a scene such as a path or walkway with lines/points you can measure the distance from
  - focus at infinity
  - take several shots of that scene using different aperture and focal settings
  - check how close gets the depth of field

## Shutter speed
- What shutter speed can you handhold?
